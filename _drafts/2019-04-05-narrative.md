# Near Future

Last week, we were tasked with coming up with possible stories under the theme of "Near Future".

Topher and I came up with the roughly the following:

*You are the research team of the famous Dr. Maria Sanchez, who has recently gone missing after refusing to turn over the findings of her latest secret project to some big evil tech company. She has left you with a series of cryptic instructions to recover the project. After rifling through her lab, you discover that she was silenced after discovering time travel, and you repair the machine to go back in time and save Dr. Sanchez!*

Some key features of our idea were:
- Funny hats for the researchers
- First objective: gaining access to her office
- Second objective: time travel machine, which would need to be repair and activated (many possible cool effects to show time travel)
- After activating the time travel machine, things in the room would change date and new puzzles
- Third objective: save Dr. Sanchez!

As a class, one consensus we quickly ended up with was including time travel, and potentially implicating modern tech companies in some grand conspiracy.

We also discussed the following ideas:
- Train as a setting
- Tragedy, rather than a heist
  - Scientist locks team in room to steal time travel project to change some personal event in the past
  - Escaping the room would reveal the machine malfunctioned

I felt that the outline Topher and I came up with was the strongest concept. The train idea lacked a story and might overcomplicate set design, and the tragedy seems rather dark for an escape room game.

# Iterating

Ultimately, we didn't come to a consensus on an idea, but the important point was raised about creating a compelling setting for time travel. "Office" was obvious, but boring, and could be made a lot more exciting without complicating the room design (e.g. "Underground lab").

Some goals for the story:

- Stronger setting for immersion
- Simplify story to facilitate gameplay
  - Should "raise the stakes" for players
  - Establish a clear objective
- Story elements that can be translated into props, set design, effects, puzzles
