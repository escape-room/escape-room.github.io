  <h1><em>ELITE UNIVERSITY POISED FOR CORPORATE TAKEOVER</em></h1>
  <p class="info">

    The Mathematical Academy for the Advancement of Technology, a long-standing elite public university, is now poised to become a branch of the Institute for Corporate Research. The controversial deal had been delayed pending a decision from the US Department of Education, which in recent years has adopted a controversial policy of allowing corporations to purchase universities.

    “It’s a great day for ICR, and it’s a great day for America,” said Institute for Corporate Research CEO Samwell Connors at a press conference yesterday evening, “all students deserve a chance for a first-class education.” ICR has purchased over 50 universities in the past decade, and has garnered some controversy for raising tuition and claiming up to 80% of all graduates’ future earnings.

    One of the most vocal opponents to the deal has been celebrated physicist Dr. Maria Sanchez. “I can never let them find it,” Dr. Sanchez was heard muttering in her office on Friday, adding “they’ll use it for evil. I’ll have to break it into pieces. Lord help us if they ever find what’s on page 50.” Sources have yet to confirm what that could possibly mean.
