  <h1><em>FAMED RESEARCHER REPORTED MISSING</em></h1>
  <p class="info">
    By Salad Whitman, May 13<sup>th</sup>, 2053

  <p>
    NEW YORK CITY — Nobel Prize winning scientist Dr. Maria Sanchez was reported yesterday, according to her colleagues at the Mathematical Academy for Advancing Technology, a branch of the Institute for Corporate Research.
  </p>
  <p>
    The head of the institute, Dr. Samwell Connors, gave a statement yesterday evening. “Of course, we are saddened by the loss of Dr. Sanchez. She was one of the world’s brilliant minds, and the world won’t forget her.”
  </p>
  <p>
    When reminded by a reporter that Dr. Sanchez hadn’t been reported dead yet, Dr. Connors responded, “Yes, yes, of course. Uh… well, we’re certainly hoping she’ll turn up.”
  </p>
  <p>
    Dr. Sanchez, who won a Nobel Prize for her pioneering work on the potential implications of Einstein’s theory of General Relativity for the possibility of time travel, had been working on a secretive project at the time of her disappearance.
  </p>
  <p>
    Sanchez had been a vocal opponent of the recent hostile takeover of MAAT by the Institute for Corporate Research. Authorities say that her disappearance does not appear to be related to her activism.
  </p>
  <p>
    Friends had noted that Dr. Sanchez had been behaving strangely for the past few weeks. We talked to one neighbor, who noted “She had been screaming up and down the halls of our building at night. ‘Calcium and Lithium!’ she would scream. The whole night just ‘Calcium and Lithium!’ It was really annoying.”
  </p>
  <p>
    At press time, none of her research team could be reached for comment.
